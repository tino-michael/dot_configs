# This script shows you a list of keyboard shortcuts for your favourite programmes.
# Call it without arguments and a dmenu will show so you can select your desired programme.
# You can either run it from a terminal or trigger it with a keyboard shortcut.
# If you run it from a terminal, the shortcut list will be printed back onto the terminal.
# If you call it with a system shortcut, the resulting list will be piped into another dmenu
# making the list nicely searchable.
# You can also call it with the name of the programme you want to look up as first argument
# and immediately get the resulting shortcut list.
# The files with the shortcuts are looked up in `${XDG_DATA_HOME}/keys`, one file per
# programme with the name of the programme as the name of the file.
