# Querries your pass password store for password files and displays them in a dmenu
# for selection. Copies the selection into the clipboard (using `pass -c` option).
#
# In contrast to the usual implementations that are floating around, this version also
# supports generating one-time-pad (OTP) tokens for two-factor-authentications (2fa) by
# testing if the path starts with `otp` -- which means, you have to sort your otp files
# accordingly.
#
# It also replace dashes in the path name with right-arrows for the display in dmenu to
# make the path less crammed and more visually appealing.
