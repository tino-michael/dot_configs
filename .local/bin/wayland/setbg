# Sets the desktop wallpaper using `swaybg`.
# swaybg runs as a background process and does not terminate if a new process is called.
# Instead, there will be two swaybg processes running. So kill the one that is running when trying
# to replace the current wallpaper.
#
# If a file or directory is given as first argument, sets the wallpaper to that file
# or picks a random one from the directory.
# If no argument is given, does the same again, i.e. sets the single file again or picks a
# new one from the directory.
# It manages so by setting a sym-link to the given resource at ${XDG_DATA_HOME}/wallpaper.
# Can be used at startup to set the wallpaper or, when pointed to a directory, put in a
# loop to create a random walpaper slideshow.
