# Instead of the app's usual config, append `.in` to its name and use
# `%clfg%`, `%colbg%`, `%clX%` with X from 1 to 15 as placeholders for
# the xresources colour names that you want to use.
# This script sed-replaces these placeholders and saves the result as
# the intended config file (without the `.in`-suffix).
