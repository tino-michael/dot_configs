# Sets the desktop wallpaper using `feh`.
# Inspired by Luke Smith (https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz) but made more flexible to also
# deal with directories.
#
# If a file or directory is given as first argument, sets the wallpaper to that file
# or picks a random one from the directory.
# If no argument is given, does the same again, i.e. sets the single file again or picks a
# new one from the directory.
# It manages so by setting a sym-link to the given resource at ${XDG_DATA_HOME}/wallpaper.
# Can be used at startup to set the wallpaper or, when pointed to a directory, put in a
# loop to create a random walpaper slideshow.

WALLPAPER=${XDG_DATA_HOME}/wallpaper
