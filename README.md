# Dot-Configs

In this repository, I present my config files for my most used programmes and many (in my
opinion) very useful scripts and snippets to streamline one workflow or another.
I will try to populate the different subfolders with more README files outlining my ideas,
what some settings do and my rational for doing things this way or another.

This repository is now setup such that you can directly check it out into your `$HOME`.
I suggest -- when you do -- to use the `deploy` branch. The only difference to the `main` being
that it does not include this `README.md` and the `LICENSE` files to pollute `$HOME`.

## My Setup

Currently, I am running an Arch Linux with my custom build of [dwm](https://github.com/tino-michael/dwm.git)
with polybar as status bar.
I listen to and organise my music with a mixture of mpc and Cantata, both connected to the
same mpd running in the background.
I use Brave as browser with pass and Browserpass for password storage.
Coming way back from KDE, I still like and use, Gwenview and Okular.
Occasionally, I might even open Dolphin from time to time but I pretty much phased it out in favour
of `lf` with `lfrun`.

## Credits

Many of the scripts and settings are my own doing. Others where heavily inspired or
flat out copied from other people. Probably most notably Luke Smith whom I blame for my
switching from i3 to dwm and many of the rabbit holes I dove down.
I will give credit where credit is due in the top comment of the corresponding files.
