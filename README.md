# Dot-Configs

In this repository, I present my config files for my most used programmes and many (in my
opinion) useful skripts and snippets to streamline one workflow or another.
I will try to populate the different subfolders with more README files outlining my ideas,
what some settings do and my rational for doing things this way or another.

## Setup

Currently, I am running an Arch Linux with my custom build of [dwm](https://github.com/tino-michael/dwm.git)
with polybar as status bar.  
I listen and organise my music with a mixture of mpc and Cantata, both connected to the
same mpd running in the background.  
I use Brave as browser with pass and Browserpass for password storage.  
Coming way back from KDE, I still use Dolphin, Gwenview and Okular. I am quite happy with
the latter two but getting more and more annoyed with Dolphin and look into replacing it
with lf soon.

## Credits

Many of the scripts and settings are my own doing. Others where heavily inspired or
flat out copied from other people. Probably most notably Luke Smith whom I blame for my
switching from i3 to dwm and many of the rabbit holes I dove down.  
I will give credit where credit is due in the top comment of the corresponding files.
